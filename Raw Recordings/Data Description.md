# Format of the raw EEG recordings

The raw data is held in .txt documents. Data is labeled along the top row after 4 lines of information about the number of channels and the sampling rate. Each row represents the data for one sample. Data is available for the voltage measured at each channel, readings from the accelerometers, timestamps, and data labeled as "other." Data are seperated by spaces.
